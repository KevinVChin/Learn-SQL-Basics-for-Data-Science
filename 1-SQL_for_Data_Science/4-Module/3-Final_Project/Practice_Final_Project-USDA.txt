Now that you have your data loaded into SQLite tables, I’ve created some sample questions for you to practice for the final project. 

If you can answer all of the questions in this practice section, you should be well prepared for the final exam. Take your time and practice as many times as you need to.

Here is the link to the previous reading with the final project instructions and used datasets:

Q1) Find the total milk production for the year 2023.

SQL Query:

-- 1
SELECT
	Year,
	Commodity_ID,
	SUM(Value) AS MilkProduction
FROM
	milk_production
WHERE
	Year = 2023;


SQL Output:

Year|Commodity_ID|MilkProduction|
----+------------+--------------+
2023|           5|   91812000000|


A1) 91812000000





Q2) Show coffee production data for the year 2015.

What is the total value?

SQL Query:

-- 2
SELECT
	Year,
	Commodity_ID,
	SUM(Value) AS CoffeeProduction
FROM
	coffee_production
WHERE
	Year = 2015;


SQL Output:

Year|Commodity_ID|CoffeeProduction|
----+------------+----------------+
2015|           1|         6600000|


A2) 6600000





Q3) Find the average honey production for the year 2022.

SQL Query:

-- 3
SELECT
	Year,
	Commodity_ID,
	AVG(Value) AS AvgHoneyProduction
FROM
	honey_production
WHERE
	Year = 2022;


Year|Commodity_ID|AvgHoneyProduction|
----+------------+------------------+
2022|           2|         3133275.0|


A3) 3133275





Q4) Get the state names with their corresponding ANSI codes from the state_lookup table.

What number is Iowa?

SQL Query:

-- 4
SELECT
	State,
	State_ANSI
FROM
	state_lookup
WHERE
	State = 'IOWA';


SQL Output:

State|State_ANSI|
-----+----------+
IOWA |        19|


A4) 19





Q5) Find the highest yogurt production value for the year 2022.

SQL Query:

-- 5
SELECT
	Year,
	State_ANSI,
	MAX(Value) AS MaxYogurtProduction
FROM
	yogurt_production
WHERE 
	Year = 2022;


SQL Output:

Year|State_ANSI|MaxYogurtProduction|
----+----------+-------------------+
2022|        36|793256000          |


A5) 793256000





Q6) Find states where both honey and milk were produced in 2022.

Did State_ANSI "35" produce both honey and milk in 2022?

SQL Query:

-- 6
SELECT
	hp.Year,
	hp.State_ANSI,
	hp.Value AS HoneyValue,
	mp.Value AS MilkValue
FROM
	honey_production hp INNER JOIN milk_production mp ON hp.State_ANSI = mp.State_ANSI 
WHERE 
	(hp.State_ANSI = 35) AND (hp.Year = 2022);


SQL Output:

Year|State_ANSI|HoneyValue|MilkValue|
----+----------+----------+---------+


A6) No





Q7) Find the total yogurt production for states that also produced cheese in 2022.

SQL Query:

-- 7 JOIN
SELECT
	yp.Year,
	yp.State_ANSI,
	SUM(DISTINCT yp.Value) AS YogurtProduced
FROM 
	yogurt_production yp LEFT JOIN cheese_production cp ON yp.State_ANSI = cp.State_ANSI 
WHERE
	(yp.Year = 2022);


-- 7 SUBQUERY
SELECT
	Year,
	State_ANSI,
	SUM(Value) AS YogurtProduced
FROM 
	yogurt_production
WHERE
	Year = 2022 AND State_ANSI IN (
		SELECT
			DISTINCT State_ANSI
		FROM
			cheese_production
		WHERE
			Year = 2022
		);


SQL Output:

Year|State_ANSI|YogurtProduced|
----+----------+--------------+
2022|         6|    1171095000|


A7) 1171095000
